## Deep Space Tools

Consider the following thought experiment: a deep space explorer in need of using his laptop for work. Which programs won't work? Why is that the case? How can it be addressed? This project is my response to this thought experiment.

## Objective
Devise a set of software tools that enable deep space explorers use earth-designed operating systems, software, and databases with the interoperability expected on earth.

## Areas of interest
- Deep space communications
- Database caching
- Operating systems


## Initial set of tools
- Browser plugin for chrome, in which the user can test high latency's effect on web resources
- Orbital dynamics latency api
- Virtual Machine with high latency networking as a sandbox environment to further develop tools
- Plugins for commercial databases
	*postgres
	*sql
	*Oracle
	*Salesforce
	*SAP
- Plugins for commercial operating systems
	* linux
	* bsd
	* windows
